## Preprocessors

This directory provides preprocessors as a reference to facilitate the usage of this repository. The preprocessor serves to match the column names defined differently in each country. Parter customs can either make their preprocessor to convert the variable name, as well as modifying the `preprocess` method in `./dataset.py` to run our code.
